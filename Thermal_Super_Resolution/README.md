Thermal imaging is a widely used technique in many applications and is under continuous
development, one of its limits is the relatively coarse spatial resolution. Nevertheless, a
number of super-resolution algorithms have been developed which allow to enhance the
resolution of the images.Due to lack in hardware ,it is challenging to obtain Images with
high resolution .Thermal Image Super-resolution focuses on the ways to enhance the
resolution of Thermal Images using Image processing Techniques. In order to achieve this
image enhancement process, a new thermal images data set is used. Different experiments
have been carried out, firstly, the proposed architecture has been trained using only images
of the visible spectrum, and later it has been trained with images of the thermal spectrum. Identification of object in an image plays a crucial role in UAVs, self-autonomous vehicles, and other applications. It is vital to have the capability to navigate and identify objects at
any time of the day, especially at night, when we encounter situations of low-light and dark
conditions. In those times thermal images serves us a lot of details which cannot be found
in RGB images.Experiments have been conducted on three databases with both indoor and
outdoor scenes. Comparative analyses validate that the proposed method enhances the
spatial information better than the state-of-arts methods, with spectral information
preserving simultaneously.

In this project, we propesed a model 'ThermalSuperNet'. To run and test the model, please follow the steps.
